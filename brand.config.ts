 *
 *  This is the ONLY file most people need to edit to make the starter their own.
 *
 *  1. Edit the values below.
 *  2. Run:  npm run brand
 *
 *  The `brand` script propagates everything that can't be imported at runtime
 *  (package.json name, README title, theme colors in globals.css, env hints).
 *  Everything else (site name in the UI, <title>, OG metadata, footer, links)
 *  is imported directly from this file, so it updates the instant you save.
 *
 *  Colors use OKLCH — a perceptual color space. Keep the same lightness/chroma
 *  and just change the hue (the 3rd number) to re-skin the whole site:
 *    hue 265 = violet · 230 = blue · 160 = emerald · 25 = red · 70 = amber
